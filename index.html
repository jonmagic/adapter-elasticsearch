        <h2>The What</h2>

<p>This adapter brings <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">ElasticSearch</a> as a database to <a href="http://github.com/jnunemaker/toystore">Toystore</a>. Using your search index as your database (if it can be made reliable) is fun to think about and use on projects that focus on chat, documentation, and more.</p>

<p>ElasticSearch is a schema free document based search engine based on Apache Lucene. By design you can stuff your entire document (hashes, strings, arrays, etc) into ElasticSearch, and then define what analyzers it should use to index the content and make it easily searchable.</p>

<p>Toystore is an object mapper for any adapter that implements read, write, delete, and clear. Other adapters include <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/adapter-mongo">adapter-mongo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/adapter-riak">adapter-riak</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bkeepers/adapter-git">adapter-git</a>.</p>

<h2>The Why</h2>

<p>We had an app that used to rely heavily on a 3rd party service as its main database, with a local copy stored in ElasticSearch and Redis. Eventually we realized our local copy in ES was more reliable than any other source, and made it our primary database. This adapter made that process easier.</p>
